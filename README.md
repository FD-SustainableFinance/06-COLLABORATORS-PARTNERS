# [6] PARTNERS

## Becoming a Partner - No Fees
For the moment, we are keeping it simple, with no fees and with candidate partners assessed for membership based on the value they may bring to the project.

### To explore becoming a partner, contact [Johnny Mattimore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnny-d-mattimore-082969136/).

## Types of Partner
Each Partner has a team, found on [TEAMS](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/teams), which is classified as follows:

| Partner Types | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Contributing | Provides resources when possible and where applicable to support the research, design, build and maintenance of taxonomies and on the tactical and strategic prioritisation and additions to the backlog of taxonomies |
| Observing | Provides guidance when possible and where applicable on the tactical and strategic prioritisation and additions to the backlog of taxonomies |
